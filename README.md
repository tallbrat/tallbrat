### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### Iâ€™m neither from a design, Comp tech, nor business background but my higher level of curiosity and faster understanding and enthusiasm are my current assets.
ðŸ’ª I'm proficient with 
**Jenkins** for Tool integration,
**Terraform** for deploying AWS services,
**Docker** for packing the application in an isolated environment,
**Trevy** for checking the vulnerability of the code which introduces DevSecOps to the CI pipeline.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Bash Scripting, DevOps, Kube

âš¡ Fun fact: Civil Engineering graduate stepping into IT Industry.
