### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### Iâ€™m neither from a design, Comp tech, nor business background but my higher level of curiosity and faster understanding and enthusiasm are my current assets.
ðŸ’ª I'm proficient with 
**Jenkins** for Tool integration,
**Terraform** for deploying AWS services,
**Docker** for packing the application in an isolated environment
**Pandas** for Data handling
**PySpark** for creating a robust transformation process on live data

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

âš¡ Fun fact: Civil Engineer learning to CODE.
